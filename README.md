_"The new 2-dimensional laser range sensor operates using tried-and-tested Pulse Ranging Technology and boasts a range of unique features. For example, the device features a laser emitter with a visible red light. Users can see where the scanning level is and can align the device accordingly. Thanks to its classification in laser class 1, the device can be used in all workspaces, without posing a health hazard to people. The device has a measuring angle of 360Â° and boasts a measuring frequency of up to 250,000 individual measurements per second. Combined with a scanning frequency of up to 50 Hz, the device is extremely well suited to highspeed applications. Another feature is the display integrated in the lens aperture."_ (from the official datasheet with permission from Pepperl+Fuchs)
